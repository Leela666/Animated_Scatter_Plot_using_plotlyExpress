# Animated_Scatter_Plot_using_plotlyExpress
This is an animated scatter plot on our own dataset.

Name of the dataset is: Student Mental Health.

The dataset we used here is an data collected after conducting a survey among college students using google forms.
 
I have uploaded the dataset here.

In plotly we have so many animations, "Animated Scatter Plot" is one of that.

Scatter Plot: The scatter plot is simply a set of data points plotted on an x and y axis to represent two sets of variables. It often says about the correlation in data.

In Animated Scatter Plot we have included the simple animations like buttons to the graph.

In this graph I have plotted the scatter plot between "Department" and "Are_you_happy_with_your_department_work_area".

As a result we got the graph like the image uploaded here.

By the graph we came to a conclusion that,

Many students are happy with their department and they are having less stress.
